# Pig dice game

Pig is a simple dice game. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
Knowing the rules of the game, I decided to try to recreate it in Python to stimulate my gray cells.

# Backlog:
[ ] repair bug
  when player has 20 pts during one round he does not win immediately
[ ] add the ability to add players' names
[ ] add the possibility to play with more than 2 players
[ ] create the option of two-dice Pig
